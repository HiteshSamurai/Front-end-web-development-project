        <div class="school"><li><p> I attended<strong>S.A.V. High School</strong>, a relatively unknown institution in the erstwhile sleepy suburb of a growing city. Though I had the best learning experience there, it is a common trend accross India that sports and cocurricular activities are not much encouraged. Even then, we did have competitions within our school and I excelled in<strong>elocution, art and prompt writing</strong>. My best achievement was getting an <strong>all Telangana 10th rank in CLB Science Talent Search Examination, 2017.</strong> This achievement inspired me to take up coaching for JEE.</p></li> </div>
        <div class="school"> <li><p>After completing my 10th grade, I attended <strong>Little Flower Junior College, Uppal,</strong>which is one of the best junior colleges in our city. Studying<strong>MPC (Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry)</strong>under the guidance of well versed lecturers was a blessing. Another important aspect of this college is the strict discipline as mandated by missionary schools, which has been of great utility to me in my life. I also made great friends along the way who are doing well. </p></li> </div>
        <div class="school"><li><p>After a tiresome 12-month-long struggle, I was successful in cracking the toughest exam in India - the JEE-ADVANCED. I was able to secure mechanical engineering programme at IIT Ropar. I really like the experience I am having at IIT Ropar.</p> 
            <p>First thing is that you can find a dedicated motivating tribe of people with great aspirations like you. Second thing is that a multiethnic community with people coming from spectrum of views mean that students have a higher chance of embracing progressive thinking and tolerance. Third is the university culture that encourages a myraid of activities other than studying like research, critical thinking, cocurricular activities like sport, art and music, taking up the roles of POR in your favourite clubs and leadership roles.</p></li></div>
