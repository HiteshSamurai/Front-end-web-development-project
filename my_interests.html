        <h2 id="interest">My interests</h2>
        <p>While talking about interests, I generally make a distinction between aptitude and skill. Our interests need not be those domains in which we have inherent aptitude, and certainly I don't have much aptitude in my passions. What I had is relentless drive and a spirit of perseverence that helped me develop my interests.</p>
        <p>So here are my interests:</p>
        <dl>
        <dt class="lang">Languages</dt>

                <dd></dd>
                <dl class="quote">"If I speak to a man in the language he knows, it will reach his brain. If I instead speak in the language he speaks, it will reach his heart"</dl>
            </dl>
            Despite having somewhat of a stutter, I like learning and speaking new languages. I started learning French and Spanish during the pandemic on Duolingo app. 
            <p>English, though taught in Indian schools, doesn't come to us Indians naturally. Hollywood movies especially Harry Potter ones, documentaries and my own avid reading of non-fiction helped me cultivate my English skills</p>
        </dd>
        <dt class="lang" id="art">Art</dt>
        <dd>I am learning art since 6th grade. Starting from cartoons, now I have aquired a decent level of skill set that enables me to do live sketching. I also learnt to paint scenaries. Though I don't paint often nowadays, owing to my tight schedule, when I do, I pour my soul into it. It is something I can keep doing tirelessly for hours. I am forever grateful to my late drawing teacher for his tireless effort in bringing the best out of me.</dd>
        <dt class="lang" id="chess">Chess</dt>
        <dd>Chess is my favourite game and though I am just an average chess player, I always try to make my game better by studying my previous games. Chess is really good to improve brain function and playing it regularly has improved my critical thinking and stategic thinking. Anyday I would prefer a 10-minute chess game over a PUBG or Freefire game.</dd>
        <dt class="lang" id="astronomy">Astronomy</dt>
        <dd>Being a science and philosophy geek alike, I cannot help but yearn to know what lies beyond our little world. On the science side it is a never ending quest to deduce the laws that hold all of these together, on philosophical side it is a contemplation of our human life, experience, death and overall purpose of it. So I like to learn topics related to astronomy like stars, galaxies, atmosphere and composition of other planets, big bang, blackholes, the effect of time on space and that of space on time and what not.</dd>
